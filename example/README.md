# Example

This is a basic example demonstrating the functionality of the wakelock plugin, including enabling & disabling the wakelock and also retrieving the current wakelock status using a `FutureBuilder`.

See [`example/lib/main.dart`](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/wakelock/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart).
